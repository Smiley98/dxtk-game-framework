Meshconvert
    -cw: faces are clockwise (defaults to counter-clockwise) for generating normals

Model
    CreateFromVBO(Flags flags = ModelLoader_Clockwise)

ModelMesh Draw
    deviceContext->RSSetState(ccw ? states.CullCounterClockwise() : states.CullClockwise());

Basically everything works as expected out of the box.

I'm still not 100% confident because I think there's a mis-match between how I exported my faces in blender vs how I'm loading them.
Also the van is horrible overall so I should install blender and clean it up even though its not causing problems at the moment.
