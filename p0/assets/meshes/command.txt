./meshconvert.exe <name>.obj -n -op -flipv -vbo -y

objs are un-triangulated for better workflow in the odd chance I actually want to modify them.
meshconvert is smart enough to triangulate faces and generate normals so the only blender box that
needs to be checked when exporting objs is Write Materials.
